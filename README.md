	Project Description
This document outlines the requirements to develop of a software solution that addresses the issue of rail transport accessibility for people with disabilities. It will demonstrate the issue at hand and the necessary requirements needed in order to complete a satisfactory solution.  
The software solution will require two applications. An application for the intended user and an application for the Irish Rail employee. 
The intended customers for the client application are primarily people with physical disabilities whose physical needs require the assistance of Irish rail members to board the train. 
The intended customers for the staff application are Irish Rail employees who are rostered to man the required stations and assist customers.

	Project Scope
This software solution is primarily targeted at the Dart rail service using the Android Studio Environment for development.
The scope of the project is to develop a system that will gather the required information on Irish Rail Dart real-time staffing arrangements, relay that information to the user and enable the user to send notifications to the relevant station employee. 
A cloud-based database will facilitate the information exchange between both applications in real time.
The Irish Rail API will also facilitate the provision of live Dart rail movements and times to the system.

	Project Objectives
•	The system will enable the user to know which stations are manned prior to travelling.<br>
•	The system will give up to date live feedback on employee movements to the user when travelling.<br>
•	Employees will be kept up to date on customer locations while travelling.<br>
•	Employees will be notified when customers are within the vicinity and in need of assistance.<br>
